## Background

### Since AI programs are not user-friendly.We decided to integrate AI into visualization programs to assist doctors in diagnosis.
The project is divided into two main parts, the first of which is NLP. The doctor uses voice input instructions. The second part is image editing, including functions such as the designation of the image zoom in and out area. Physician assistance is also given to the area of the delineated tumor.
## Install

git clone https://github.com/Hikari0727/TumorImageEditor.git
